# My First Site

This was the first site I created completely from scratch (before I ever knew that Bootstrap existed). I did use one outside source to help host my resume in a PDF Viewer, but other than that all styling and functionality was 100% coded by me. I had to do a lot of research, as I had limited knowledge of coding at the time.

I decided to move all my files here to host them on heroku for display, as I'm still very proud of what I accomplished in this project!

### Languages/Technologies Used'
- HTML
- CSS
- little bit of PHP for contact form
- PDF Viewer (called ViewerJS)
