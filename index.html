  <p><i>Welcome to my website! It's taken a lot of hard work and time, but it's finally here. Authenticity is very important to me, so of course I applied my philosophy to this project. I wanted my website to be authentic, so I tried to build almost every aspect by myself. Not from a template. Templates are easy to come by.</i></p>
  <p><b> A little bit about me:</b></p>
  <p>Come May 2016, I will be a graduate from The University of Texas at Austin, with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy accompanied by a Business Certificate from the Red McCombs School of Business.</p>
  <p>I discovered my passion for video, media, and editing early on in my high school career through the Media Tech Program offered. Over the timespan of three years, I became proficient in programs such as Final Cut Pro, Photoshop, and Flash. Being involved in various projects, some responsibilities include: writing and directing music videos; hosting, filming, and editing video segments to be provided for the daily broadcast.</p>
   <p>Further pursuing my passion for media led me to The University of Texas at Austin. While in college, I have worked on various freelance projects ranging from wedding videos to short films.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Among the Grand Prairie Independent School District I have filmed and edited various music performances such as the Grand Prairie High School Mariachi Concerts and the Garner Fine Arts Academy musicals and performances.</p>
  <p>As well as video, I’ve done photography work for German artist Michael Just. Shown at his art exhibit “What’s Done Cannot be Undone” of January 2015 at the <a href="http://www.cydoniagallery.com/exhibitions/#">Cydonia Gallery</a> in Dallas, TX, photos were taken of the Lady Macbeth sculpture found at the Elisabet Ney Museum for Just’s work.</p>
