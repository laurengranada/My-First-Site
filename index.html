  <p><i>Welcome to my website! It's taken a lot of hard work and time, but it's finally here. Authenticity is very important to me, so of course I applied my philosophy to this project. I wanted my website to be authentic, so I tried to build almost every aspect by myself. Not from a template. Templates are easy to come by.</i></p>
  <p><b> A little bit about me:</b></p>
  <p>I am a soon-to-be graduate from The University of Texas at Austin, with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy accompanied by a Business Certificate from the Red McCombs School of Business.</p>
  <p>I discovered my passion for media, editing, and film in high school through a Media Tech Program. Being involved in the program for three consecutive years, I learned the basics in programs such as: Final Cut Pro, Flash, and Photoshop. Projects ranged from writing and directing music videos, to hosting, filming and editing video segments for the school-wide news show.</p>
  <p>I primarily moved to Austin to further pursue my passion for media. While in college, I’ve done various freelance projects varying from weddings to short films.</p>
  <p>When it comes to new things, I adapt very quickly! For example with this website, I learned the very basics of coding an HTML site in an MIS course about a year ago. Setting my creative gears in motion, I wanted to learn more, and I found several resources like code academy to teach myself more advanced coding techniques.</p>
  <p>I like understanding how things work, so I don’t mind taking the initiative to further my knowledge of the subject, whether it be a program or a project.</p>
  <p>In my projects, I love having the opportunity to tell a story and express creativity. Through a platform like video I am given more than enough room to be able to do so.</p>
  <p>Being able to pour myself into my career is something I’m looking for.</p>
